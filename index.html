        <ul>

          <li> There are (3) ways to style a webpage using CSS: <b>Inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet,</b>and <b> external CSS style sheet.</b></li>
          <li>A <b>margin</b> indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A <b>padding</b> indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li><b>Class attributes</b> act as a CSS rule that can be used to designate certain elements (with associated class selector) that are affected by CSS styling while others are not </li>          
          <li> We can style HTML elements using the elements themselves as selectors or using class attributes as selectors (To affect multiple elements at once).</li>

          <li> A <b>variable (var)</b> is a named container that allows us to store data in our code </li>
          <li> <b>Control flow</b> is the order in which a computer executes a code in a script (<em>Order Matters.</em>)</li>
          <li> Control flow can be interrupted by using <b>conditional statements</b> and <B>loops</B> to control which code, if any, will be executed.</li>

          <li> An <b>Array</b> is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data (Typically related in some way). Since the contents of the array become indexed, it makes testing different values much easier.</li>
