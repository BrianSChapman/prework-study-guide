# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

There's so much information that is presented in prework prior to joining a bootcamp. This webpage acts a succinct, easy to digest means to touch on various topics covered in the U-Penn prework modules covered. It's doubly beneficial because all of the topics that were touched - HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript - were all needed to present this information in the clear, concise state it's in.

Notes taken on each prework topic - HTML, CSS, Git, Javascript - are presented to be looked over. Utilize the Chrome DevTools console with CTRL + SHIFT + I. You'll find that Javascript will list topics and suggest the focal point to study.
